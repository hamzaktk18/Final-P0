# Final-P0
Final Project P0

This is our final project for the CSC 226 class by Dr. Scott Heggen. 

This project was inspired by the teamwork A3: A Pair of Fully Functional Gitty Psychedelic Robotic Turtles. We originally started by Hamza's code. Prerequisites: Pycharm, Anaconda.

When the user runs the code a window will show up and the user eventually gets play a re-invented funnier mario game. The game asks the user to avoid any collision between "mario" and the obstacle "Dj Khaled" that keeps going back and forth trying to hit mario. Whenever the obstacle and mario collide the game will eventually pop up a new window which will show the final score hence end the game.

We started with the code in A05 which was shareb by Professor Scott Heggen in class.
